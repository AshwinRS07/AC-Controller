# AC-Controller
Automated AC Temperature Controller
This is a project I took up as part of a one-month internship. This device controls nearby Air Conditioners as if it were an AC Remote.
The current version, which is unlikely to be updated, maintains the temperature of AC units in it's range in a specific predefined temperature range.
This is a very simplistic implementation and has huge potential for improvement, but due to the time constraint, I was only able to develop this model of the device.
